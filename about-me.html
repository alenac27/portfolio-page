      Hello there! My name is Alena, and I am a Junior front-end developer with
      a unique background that includes years of experience as a product manager
      in software companies, as well as design skills that enhance my
      development abilities. My passion for technology and design led me to
      transition into a career in front-end development. I have already gained
      practical experience working on projects for a variety of clients. My
      design skills have given me a great eye for detail and a deep
      understanding of user experience, which I utilize to craft beautiful,
      user-friendly websites and applications. As a Junior front-end developer,
      I am constantly seeking out new learning opportunities to improve my
      skills. I am well-versed in a variety of programming languages, including
      HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Additionally, my experience as a product manager
      has taught me the importance of communication, collaboration, and
      understanding the client's needs, which I bring to every project I work
      on. I am excited to continue growing as a developer and applying my unique
      background to every project I work on. If you are looking for a skilled,
      dedicated, and creative front-end developer, please don't hesitate to
      reach out. I would love to chat with you about your project and see how I
      can help bring your vision to life. You can contact me through my
